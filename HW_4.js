number' + 3 + 3
  
//In JavaScript, when you use the + operator with a string and a number, it performs string concatenation. In the expression 'number' + 3 + 3, the first operation is the concatenation of the string 'number' with the number 3, resulting in the string 'number3'. Then, the next operation is the concatenation of this string with another number 3, resulting in the final string 'number33'.

//So, the result of the expression 'number' + 3 + 3 in JavaScript is the string 'number33'.

null + 3

//In JavaScript, when you use the + operator with null and a number, null is treated as 0 during the operation. Therefore, the result of the expression null + 3 will be 3. This is because adding 0 to any number does not change the value of that number.

//So, the result of null + 3 in JavaScript is 3.

 5 && "qwerty"


//In JavaScript, the && (logical AND) operator returns the value of the second operand if the first operand is truthy; otherwise, it returns the value of the first operand.

//In the expression 5 && "qwerty", both operands are truthy. In a logical AND operation, if both operands are truthy, the result is the value of the second operand. Therefore, the result of this expression is the string "qwerty".

+'40' + +'2' + "hillel";


//Let's break down the expression '40' + '2' + "hillel" step by step:

//.+'40': The unary plus (+) before the string '40' converts it to a number, resulting in the numeric value 40.
//+'2': Similarly, the unary plus before the string '2' converts it to a number, resulting in the numeric value 2.
//The addition +'40' + +'2' adds these two numeric values together, resulting in 42.
//Finally, the string "hillel" is concatenated to the numeric result, resulting in the string "42hillel".
//So, the overall result of the expression +'40' + +'2' + "hillel" is the string "42hillel".
