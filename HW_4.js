number' + 3 + 3
  
//In JavaScript, when you use the + operator with a string and a number, it performs string concatenation. In the expression 'number' + 3 + 3, the first operation is the concatenation of the string 'number' with the number 3, resulting in the string 'number3'. Then, the next operation is the concatenation of this string with another number 3, resulting in the final string 'number33'.

//So, the result of the expression 'number' + 3 + 3 in JavaScript is the string 'number33'.

null + 3

//In JavaScript, when you use the + operator with null and a number, null is treated as 0 during the operation. Therefore, the result of the expression null + 3 will be 3. This is because adding 0 to any number does not change the value of that number.

//So, the result of null + 3 in JavaScript is 3.
